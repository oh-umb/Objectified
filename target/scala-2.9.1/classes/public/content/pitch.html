  <h3>The Onion Revolution </h3>
  <p>Does anyone remember filing cabinets? Or that messy blue paper we used 
  to stick between 2 regular sheets to get a copy? How about white out? 
  Pecking and clacking on mechanical contraptions that smash little puddles 
  of ink onto thin strips of tree leather with tiny hammers, one glyph at a 
  time, and painting over mistakes with a tiny paint brush dipped in an 
  adorable little bucket of interior matte white, sounds like something our  
  ancient ancestors did when they out grew cave painting but had not yet mastered 
  stone tablet carving. But this is recent tech. Hell, some geisers and backwoods 
  ignerts are still holding on to the old ways even though their shameful 
  and appalling ritual sacrifice of virgin trees is hard for modern men to 
  stomach. We have become comfortable with the relentless-endless maelstrom 
  of data that permeates our existence, and adept at twisting and tweaking and 
  turning it inside out, chopping it up, smashing it flat, mixing, morphing, and 
  transforming it any which way, at will, and with ease. We are connected, 
  communicative, and well informed as we chat, broadcast, consume, blast, 
  and tweet; we catch, pass, and throw an impossible cacophony of messages 
  like some bored old cat, lazily batting at a ball of yarn.        
  </p>
  <p>We forget how cumbersome and annoying information was just 2 decades past and 
  how hard it was to handle; like chasing a dozen well greased pigs around in giant vat of canola.  
  Every business and organization on the planet had specific and unique data processing 
  requirements. Complicated and expensive processes and, in many cases, machines had to 
  be designed, manufactured and implemented before a business could even open it's doors. It 
  was a complex and convoluted endeavor that consumed vast amounts of time and energy, 
  discouraged experimentation or tinkering of any kind, and gave very little back that could 
  be considered useful. The whole scene was a smelly old mildew ridden wet blanket on the 
  whole innovation party vibe and it's a wonder the human race did not completely devolve 
  into suicidal automatons and just stop fucking altogether. 
  </p>
  <p>The drudgery was excruciating and then one day some dork crammed a bunch of switches 
  into a plain beige box and the rest is history.
