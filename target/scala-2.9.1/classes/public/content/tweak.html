  <h3>thingoplasty </h3>
  <p>Does your pig need some lipstick? Turd need polishing? We enhance, modify, restore, and transform all manner of object and make new things out of old things or piles of stuff. Give us your hand-me-downs and knick-nacks and we will stretch, tug, convert, and invert until shiny baubles glisten in their stead. Gives us your hand-me-downs and we will bleach, then tie dye, acid wash and sew them into the tanned, dried, withered, blistered, burnt, and peeled hides of your enemies. Give us gravel - empty a wheelbarrow full of it into one or our contraptions - and we will sift and sort and laser peel each pebble like a grape; decompose each mineral and salt with orchestrated chemical reactions and unravel the concoction at a molecular level by plucking each electron from it's orbit, one by one, with tiny tweazers, respinning it and knocking it about, entanglement to entanglement like bumper pool. We dissassemble, decompose, and dissect, bit by bit, until there is nothing left but a conceptual cloud of an abstraction of dust. To truly know a thing leads to it's annihilation, but places it in a ready state of non-being from which it may be reborn over and over again in increasingly rich and esoteric variation. To truly know a thing is to be Objectified.</p>
  <p>Or perhaps a nice shellack?</p>
