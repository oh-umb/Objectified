  <h3>Day Dream Compiler </h3>
  <p>Big things are happening in the world of things these days. The bells on the latests gadgets are deafneing and the whistles wake up every canine in the neighborhood. Tools are so tuff and versatile  that the entire wiss army can get by on only one knife. A matchbox car just broke the land speed record, hasbro toy ray guns had to be recalled after a 10 year old boy shot down a top secret CIA satellite, and Babrie was on the cover of Maxim and Glamour last month. </p>
  <p>Stuff in general is super shiny all of a sudden and getting sexier every minute and it's all thanks to a new breed of (semi)self-replicating (any)thing-making super-contraption that is taking the Industry industry by storm. Global production, supply, distribution, manufacturing, merchandising, disaster relief, commerce, marketing, transportation, art, medicicne, entertainment, construction, war, mining, and urban planning, for example, will be turned inside out by this revolutionary technology. Every ship, train, truck, and airplane will be rerouted, and a good portion of them mothballed, in the years to come as everything - well okay most things - will be abtainable locally. Any time, anywhere. The balance of power and distribution of wealth will shift dramaticaly from the huge reduction in production costs and localization of acquisition as well and elimenating all of those factories and ships will significantly reduce oil comsumption and green house gas emission. </p>
