  <h3>Abracadabra</h3>
	  <p>Language is what our minds do. With glyphs and marks and tones, character strings, 
	  punctuation, alphabets, and alpha-bits we make tools, art and weapons. Our 
	  history - our development as a civilization and a species - is marked by great 
	  evolutionary leaps after language related technological breakthroughs. Writing, 
	  GÃ¼tenberg, and talking drums were big but the event of the ages is happening 
	  right fucking now. Not just one actually but a series of monumental transformations 
	  are underway.</p>
	<p>First of all the ability of anyone anywhere to communicate with just about anyone 
	else - and the ubiquity of English which is for all intents and purposes a global common 
	tongue - is so far beyond profound that we are going to need a new word to describe 
	it's importance. For the first time, since a few of our distant ancestors wandered away 
	from their African village and got lost, the human race is united as one global community. 
	We are man the social animal. Each of us as much an aspect of the collective man as we 
	are individual men. Collaboration is the source of our strength. As one we gained 
	dominion over the animal kingdom. Once separated we began fighting each other.
	 This is our history and the source of all our troubles but now we have a chance to 
	 regain our former glory.</p>
	<p>This is all very inspiring but what does it have to with stuff. The additional of 
	software languages to our repertoire, and the inherent capabilities they add, 
	opens the sky and lets the heavens in. The implications are mind numbing. Now, 
	we can create languages that are radically different than anything that has come 
	before. Different languages mean different ways of thinking so this ability will open 
	countless cognitive pathways that will lead to alternate states of consciousness, new 
	angles of observation and ways of perceiving that will reveal mysteries within mysteries 
	and help us solve difficult problems. Software languages also add a creational ability to 
	our linguistic toolkit. Now we can make things with language   --- abracadabra -- dig 
	through blather notebooks and finish this.</p>
