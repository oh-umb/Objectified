  <p>Functionality is great and all - I mean, if you are into that sort of thing - but if you are looking for something completely useless then you have come to the right place. We, the right side of the collective Objectified brain, have been drawing since we were two, made our own treehouses with Lego's, and soiled our huggies with playdoh.</p>
  <p>We aspire to master every sculptural form, method, and material known to man and make up a few new ones while we are at it. To bolster and extend our repertoire, and just plain be sociable, we mingle and bond with other artists every chance we get and endeavour to collaborate and form partnerships with individuals that inspire us and extend our collective capabilities. By leveraging the power of the group we are able to fill any order and fulfill any request. And of course our fundamental rule is always: nothing that sucks. 
  </p>
  <p>In addition to any and every material, we also work with no material and continually assimilate software tools and techniques to ensure that: if it's possible, we can do it. And if it isn't possible? Well, we'll go ahead and do it anyway. We're just stubborn like that.</p>
